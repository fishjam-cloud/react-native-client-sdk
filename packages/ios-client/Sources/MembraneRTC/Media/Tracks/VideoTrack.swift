     * Every track can have 2 ids:
     * - the one from rtc engine in the form of <peerid>:<trackid>
     * - the one from webrtc library in the form of uuidv4 string (different than one from the engine)
     * It's always confusing when to use which one and we need to keep some kind of mapping.
     * What's worse a track might be sometimes missing one of the ids
     * - rtc engine id is missing when a local track is created without established connection
     * - webrtc id is missing when we get a track from rtc engine but is not yet negotiated
     * So we have a third id that is created by our client. It's always there, it's never changing
     * and we're always using it unless we talk to rtc engine or webrtc. The user sees just this id,
     * unless they want to debug something.
