    * Every track can have two IDs:
    * - the one from RTC engine in the format <peerid>:<trackid>
    * - the one from WebRTC library in the form of a UUID v4 string (different than the one from the engine)
    * It's often confusing when to use which one, and a mapping is typically needed.
    * Moreover, a track may sometimes be missing one of the IDs:
    * - RTC engine ID is missing when a local track is created without an established connection
    * - WebRTC ID is missing when a track is received from an RTC engine but has not been negotiated
    * As a solution, there is a third ID created by our client. It's always present, never changes,
    * and is always used unless communicating specifically with the RTC engine or WebRTC. This ID is what
    * the user sees, unless they need to debug something.
